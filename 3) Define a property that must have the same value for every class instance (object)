Define a class attribute”color” with a default value white. I.e., Every Vehicle should be white.

code:
class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass
